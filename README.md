# Gym-Management-App
Flask web app/gym management software 

Solo project creating a gym management app using Flask.

What does it do?: The application is intended to be used as an internal resource for a gym staff to manage members and class bookings.

What I got out of the project: Consolidated understanding of Python and Flask.

I'm proud of: the functionality of the site.

What I would change about it: I prioritised functionality over the aesthetic of the app, so further work is needed with CSS/presentation.
